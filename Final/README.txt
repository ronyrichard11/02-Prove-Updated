Hello! This is my README.txt file for my Higher Lower Program.

Any specific functions in my Higher Lower program have a comment attached to them in order for it to be understood.
I spent roughly 4 days figuring it out myself and then got stuck on a local function cannot contain reference problem. If i managed to fix that I would have had it running smoothly and everything
would loop into eachother. I couldnt figure it out so I watched a few youtube tutorials on ref and changed my approach and now this is my finished product.
